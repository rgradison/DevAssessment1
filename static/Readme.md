Dev Assessment 1

NB please use Java standard edition to complete the assessment

 We need the candidate to do two coding assignments. Once completed share with us using GitHub.

Ensure that you have shown us how you arrived at your solutions, validated that your code works and that good coding/design principles and best practices have been applied.

1.         Find the highest common factor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) for a given array of integers

// example Java function definition

public int highestCommonFactor(int[] numbers) {

  // your code here

}

2.         Given the attached addresses.json file which contains an array of address, do the following:

  a.       Write a function to return a pretty print version of an address in the format: Type: Line details - city - province/state - postal code â€“ country

  // example Java function definition

  public String prettyPrintAddress(Address address) {   // your code here

  }

  b.       Write a function to pretty print all the addresses in the attached file

  c.       Write a function to print an address of a certain type (postal, physical, business)

  d.       Write a function to validate an address

      i.  A valid address must consist of a numeric postal code, a country, and at least one address line that is not blank or null.

      ii. If the country is ZA, then a province is required as well.

  e.       For each address in the attached file, determine if it is valid or not, and if not give an indication of what is invalid in a message format of your choice.
